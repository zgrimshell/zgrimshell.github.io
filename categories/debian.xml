I started working for a great CEO and great company known as &lt;a href="https://puri.sm"&gt;Purism&lt;/a&gt;. What is so great about it? First of all, CEO (Todd Weaver), is incredible passionate about Free software. Yes, you read it correctly. Free software. Not Open Source definition, but Free software definition. I want to repeat this like a mantra. In Purism we try to integrate high-end hardware with Free software. Not only that, we want our hardware to be Free as much as possible. No, we want to make it entirely Free but at the moment we don't achieve that. So instead going the way of using older hardware (as Ministry of Freedom does, and kudos to them for making such option available), we sacrifice this bit for the momentum we hope to gain - that brings growth and growth brings us much better position when we sit at negotiation table with hardware producers. If negotiations even fail, with growth we will have enough chances to heavily invest in things such as openRISC or freeing cellular modules. We want to provide in future entirely Free hardware&amp;amp;software device that has integrated security and privacy focus while it is easy to use and convenient as any other mainstream OS. And we choose to currently sacrifice few things to stay in loop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surely that can't be the only thing - and it isn't. Our current hardware runs entirely on Free software. You can install Debian main on it and all will work out of box. I know I did this and enjoy my Debian more than ever. We also have margin share program where part of profit we donate to Free software projects. We are also discussing a lot of new business model where our community will get a lot of influence (stay tuned for this). Besides all this, our OS (called PureOS - yes, a bit misfortune that we took the name of dormant distribution), was Trisquel based but now it is Debian testing based. Current PureOS 2.0 is coming with default DE as Cinnamom but we are already baking PureOS 3.0 which is going to come with GNOME Shell as default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is this important? Well, around 12 hours ago we launched a &lt;a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/librem-11-a-2-in-1-to-protect-your-digital-life#/"&gt;tablet campaign on Indiegogo&lt;/a&gt; which comes with GNOME Shell and PureOS as default. Not one, but two tablets actually (although we heavily focus on 11" one). This is the product of mine 4 months dedicated work at Purism. I must give kudos to all Purism members that pushed their parts in preparation for this campaign. It was hell of a ride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Librem11" src="https://zgrimshell.github.io/images/librem11.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have also approached (of course!) Debian for creation of OEM installations ISOs for our Librem products. This way, with every sold Librem that ships with Debian preinstalled, Debian will get donation. It is our way to show gratitude to Debian for all the work our community does (yes, I am still extremely proud Debian dude and I will stay like that!). Oh yes, I am the chief technology person at Purism, and besides all goals we have, I also plan (dream) about Purism being the company that has highest number of Debian Developers. In that terms I am very proud to say that Matthias Klumpp became part of Purism. Hopefully we soon extend the number of Debian population in Purism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, I think it is fairly known that I am easy to approach so if anyone has any questions (as I didn't want this post to be too long) feel free to contact me. Also - in Free software spirit - we welcome any community engagement, suggestion and/or feedback.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>debian</category><category>floss</category><category>purism</category><category>tablet</category><guid>https://zgrimshell.github.io/posts/4-months-of-work-turned-into-gnome-debian-testing-based-tablet.html</guid><pubDate>Fri, 20 May 2016 13:47:54 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Interesting? :)</title><link>https://zgrimshell.github.io/posts/interesting.html</link><dc:creator>Zlatan Todoric</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;On Distrowatch Debian has more points than Ubuntu and Red Hat combined - coincidence?

While I am not religious, it has a great tradition here and probably the only day when majority of family gathers on one place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also today remember my Debian family and want to express love to it. I will try this year to dedicate much more time to Debian and hope I keep this pace going on for many years (lifetime?) to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheers to all and happy hacking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>christmas</category><category>debian</category><category>dedication</category><guid>https://zgrimshell.github.io/posts/merry-christmas.html</guid><pubDate>Thu, 07 Jan 2016 15:09:53 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Thank you ancenstor</title><link>https://zgrimshell.github.io/posts/thank-you-ancenstor.html</link><dc:creator>Zlatan Todoric</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I found out that our founding father died it really was hard for me. I took it like a real man. I cried and then I choose to write a blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I never met Ian, but he changed my life with his humble but great decision some 22 years ago. Not only mine. He changed many of us. He empowered us, he gave us something we didn't have before. Without Debian I would never be person I am today and I am happy to say that I am still growing with incredible pace everyday. Every. Single. Day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all are Ian and we will continue to keep up the fire on the torch. I can say one thing, in coming decades and centuries society is gonna get better and I am sure it will be because of Debian. Debian community will overtake the world because we are not only universal OS, we are social movement for better life where many of people I love found their home. You know, the swirl is the gear that keeps one awesome family keep going on and growing every single day. And I can be proud to say, I lived in time where Ian made a choice that changed the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you founding father, you will be remembered and celebrated forever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>debian</category><category>father</category><category>founder</category><category>ian</category><category>life</category><guid>https://zgrimshell.github.io/posts/thank-you-ancenstor.html</guid><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jan 2016 16:23:05 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Deepin switches to Debian Sid</title><link>https://zgrimshell.github.io/posts/deepin-switches-to-debian-sid.html</link><dc:creator>Zlatan Todoric</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Distribution that I feel fond of their work on UX for Linux ecosystem has switched from Ubuntu to Debian.

She is from realms of Valhalla and is setting her footprint into the community. A hacker mindset, a Free software lover and a 3D printing maker. Elena has big dedication to make the world free and better place for all. She tries to push limits on personal level with much care and love, and FLOSS community will benefit from her work and way of life in future. So what has the Viking lady to say about FLOSS? Meet Elena "of Valhalla" Grandi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="attendance pic" src="https://zgrimshell.github.io/images/debhere.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I arrived to Heidelberg Main Train Station around 9am on 15th August and almost right away found Debian people so it made my trip to hostel easier. After arrival I checked in but needed to wait for 3 hours to get the key (it seems that SA will not have that problem at all, which is already an improvement). Although waiting was 3 hours long, it wasn't actually difficult at all as I started hugging and saying hi to many old (the super old super friend of mine - moray, or how I call him, "doc") and new friends. I just must say - if you know or don't know Rhonda, try to get somehow into her hugs. With her hug I acknowledged that I really did arrive to reunion.&lt;/p&gt;

Once arch enemy of Linux world, now obviously on their knees when they must do
such things to sustain their business model. Next stop, Microsoft goes open
source, and still nobody cares. Then they go out of business - and no one
cares. Maybe they survive as open hardware producer? ^_^&lt;/p&gt;

They occupy
people who write news, who talk about FLOSS, who help on booths and
conferences, who create artistic forms of the community and so many others
that contribute in countless ways. A lady, that is doing many of that is
Francesca Ciceri, known in Debian as MadameZou. She is non-packaging Debian
Developer, a fearless warrior for diversity and a zombie fan. Although it
sounds intimidating, she is deep caring and great human being. So, what has
MadaZou to tell us?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
